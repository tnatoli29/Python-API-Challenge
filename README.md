Looking at the trends of Part 1(WeatherPy) there are many trends in the data, a few I found are:
  1. In the chart looking at City Latitude vs Max Temperature, there is an obvious curve as the latitude moves closer to 0 being that 0 is the equator. The max temp goes up as it        approaches 0 and then begins to drop again as the the points move further from 0.
 
 2. Looking at all of our linear regression charts, Max Temperature vs Latitude is the only variables that we compared that have a decently strong r-value. The northern hemisphere         is a higher r-value of 0.673088402666865 verses the southern hemisphere's r-value of 0.5550144468354739.
 
 3. In the following linear regression charts looking at Humidity vs Latitude, Cloudiness vs Latitude, and Wind Speed vs Latitude there is little to no relationship between the 2        variables. Although the relationships were weak, the Southern Hemisphere charts had stronger relationships in all three comparisons than the Northern Hemisphere.
